              What's happening:
              - Prometheus cannot scrape Envoy proxy {{$labels.pod}} for 5m in namespace network.

              Impact/risk:
              - Ingress/egress traffic metrics may be missing; proxy availability may be degraded.

              Likely causes:
              - Envoy proxy pod crashlooping or unschedulable
              - Node/network issues preventing scrape connectivity
              - Prometheus scrape/connectivity issue

              First actions:
              - Check Envoy Gateway pods/services in namespace network
              - Review pod events/logs for {{$labels.pod}}
              - Verify Prometheus can connect to the scrape endpoint
